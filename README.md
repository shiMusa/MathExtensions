# MathExtensions

## Advanced Math functions for Jai

The goal of this project is to progressively write a comprehensive
mathematical library for Jai, similar to the Gnu Scientific Library or Java Apache Math.

The focus lies in providing the functionality first, performance
second. 

Feel free to add functionality and performance upgrades.

## Structure

Let's keep it as simple as possible:

- Operator overloading where it makes sense (linear algebra, complex numbers, quaternions, etc.), simple function calls otherwise.
- No special type-aliases if not stricly necessary
- A file for each major topic.

## Important

Give sources for algorithms written so that we can take a look and help debugging.

Write (at least some) tests contained in each file.
